        "Zomato is an Indian restaurant aggregator and food delivery start-up founded by Deepinder Goyal and Pankaj Chaddah in 2008. Zomato provides information, menus and user-reviews of restaurants, and also has food delivery options from partner restaurants in select cities. India is quite famous for its diverse multi cuisine available in a large number of restaurants and hotel resorts, which is reminiscent of unity in diversity. Restaurant business in India is always evolving. More Indians are warming up to the idea of eating restaurant food whether by dining outside or getting food delivered. The growing number of restaurants in every state of India has been a motivation to inspect the data to get some insights, interesting facts and figures about the Indian food industry in each city. So, this project focuses on analysing the Zomato restaurant data for each city in India.\n",
        "\n",
        "Project focuses on Customers and Company, you have to analyze the sentiments of the reviews given by the customer in the data and make some useful conclusions in the form of Visualizations. Also, cluster the zomato restaurants into different segments. The data is vizualized as it becomes easy to analyse data at instant. The Analysis also solves some of the business cases that can directly help the customers finding the Best restaurant in their locality and for the company to grow up and work on the fields they are currently lagging in. This could help in clustering the restaurants into segments. Also the data has valuable information around cuisine and costing which can be used in cost vs: benefit analysis Data could be used for sentiment analysis. Also the metadata of reviewers can be used for identifying the critics in the industry.\n"

In order to treat with those I first replaced the null value for timing with mode since there was only one null and mode is robust to outliers plus that hotel name was one unique feature which had all other feature except timing and collection so it was better to preserve that data. Since there was more than 50% null values in collection feature, I removed the entire column because columns with a high percentage of null values are likely to have a lot of missing data, which can make it difficult to accurately analyze or make predictions based on the data.\n",

On analysing I found that feature like reviewer and reviewer total review had all null values, therefore I removed those two columns which made null values in other feature to zero except in review and reviewer followers columns. Since review was textual data, I changed those 7 null values to 'no review' and reviewer followers to 0 as follower is the meta data for reviewer and it can be 0.\n",

This can help improve the performance of models by reducing the number of unique words that need to be processed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Stemming can be used because they are common normalization techniques used in natural language processing to preprocess text data before it is fed into a model. Tokenization is the first step and it breaks down the text into individual words, which is necessary for most NLP tasks. Stemming is used to reduce the dimensionality of the data by converting words to their common form, this is useful for text classification and other NLP tasks where the meaning of the words is important.\n",
        "\n",
        "⚡In general, stemming is a more aggressive technique that can remove more of the original word form, which may make it difficult for a lemmatizer to accurately identify the base form of the word. Additionally, some stemming algorithms may create non-real words, which are difficult for a lemmatizer to handle. Therefore, if the goal is to maintain the meaning of the text and preserve more of the original word forms, it would be more appropriate to apply lemmatization before stemming. However, if the goal is to reduce all words to their base forms and to group together different forms of the same word, it may be useful to try both ways and compare the results."

These patterns, known as principal components, are linear combinations of the original features that are uncorrelated with each other. By using the first few principal components, which account for the majority of the variation in the data, one can effectively reduce the dimensionality of the data while maintaining most of the important information.\n",

Additionally, PCA can be used for data visualization by projecting high-dimensional data onto a 2D or 3D space for easy visualization.\n",

The advantage of this approach is that it can help to remove noise and correlated features from the data, which can make the clustering results more interpretable.
